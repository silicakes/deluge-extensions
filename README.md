## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with **WebMIDI support** (like Chrome, Edge, or Opera).
- Your Synthstrom Deluge connected to your computer or mobile device via **USB**.
- For mobile use: An Android device with USB OTG support or iOS device (with appropriate adapters).
- **Deluge running Community Firmware 1.3.0 or later** is required _only_ for the File Browser feature (all other functionality works on any firmware).

### Setup

1.  🔌 Connect your Deluge to your computer or mobile device via USB.
2.  📂 Open [dex.silicak.es](https://dex.silicak.es) in a compatible web browser.
3.  🔐 When prompted by the browser, **Allow** MIDI access.
4.  🖱️ Select your Deluge from the MIDI **input** and **output** dropdown menus.
    - ✨ **Pro Tip:** If a device named `Deluge Port 3` is found, DEx will try to select it automatically if 'Connect Automatically' is checked!
5.  📱 **PWA Installation** (Optional): On compatible browsers, look for the "Add to Home Screen" prompt or use the browser's install option to install DEx as a standalone app.

## How to Use 🎛️

### Main Controls

- **Auto Display**: Automatically begins polling the Deluge display as soon as a valid MIDI output is connected (toggleable).
- **Start Display Refresh**: Manually begins polling the Deluge for display updates (OLED or 7-Segment).
- **Display Type Toggle**: Switch between the OLED (right) and 7-Segment (left) displays using the convenient slider.
- **Get Debug Messages**: Manually requests the latest debug info from the Deluge.
- **Monitor UI Changes**: Toggles the UI monitoring mode on/off.
- **Full Screen**: Enters a distraction-free fullscreen mode that optimizes the display for your current device and screen size. Press 'ESC' or tap the button again to exit.
- **📸 Screenshot**: Download a snapshot of the current canvas as a PNG by clicking the camera icon or pressing 's'.
- **📋 Copy Base64**: Copy the current OLED display as a gzipped, base64-encoded string (in a markdown directive) by clicking the copy icon or pressing 'c'.
- **❓ Keyboard Help**: View all available keyboard shortcuts by clicking the question mark icon or pressing '?'.
- **⚙️ (Gear Icon)**: Opens the Advanced Settings Drawer.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

DEx provides convenient keyboard shortcuts for common actions:

- **S**: Capture screenshot
- **C**: Copy canvas as base64
- **F**: Toggle fullscreen
- **+ / =**: Increase canvas size
- **-**: Decrease canvas size
- **?**: Toggle keyboard shortcuts help overlay

### Advanced Settings Drawer

- **OLED Display Settings**: Customize pixel size and colors. Click 'Apply Settings' to see changes and save them.
- **Display Controls**: Manually trigger OLED/7-Segment updates, run a Ping test, or test internal decoding functions.
- **Deluge Info**: Get Firmware Version and Features Status.
- **Custom SysEx**: Input field and 'Send' button for arbitrary commands. Clickable examples provided!
- **Debug Output**: Shows incoming debug messages, version info, etc. Features 'Clear' and 'Auto Debug' buttons.

### Mobile Usage Tips

**iOS currently doesn't support WebMIDI in its common browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc.).
Although some third-party browsers claim patched support, I can't recommend any because I don't use iPhone.**

- For the best experience on mobile devices, use the **Full Screen** button to maximize the display.
- On Android, you may need a USB OTG (On-The-Go) adapter to connect your Deluge.
  Although for me, it works with a regular USB-C to USB-B cable.
-
- Rotate your device to landscape orientation for an optimal viewing experience.
- Press 'f' on external keyboards or tap the Full Screen button again to exit fullscreen mode.

### PWA & Offline Features

DEx is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing these benefits:

- **📴 Offline Access**: The app's interface will load even without an internet connection.
- **⚡ Faster Loading**: Assets are cached for quicker startup times on subsequent visits.
- **🏠 Installable**: Add DEx to your home screen for app-like access without opening a browser.
- **🔔 Update Notifications**: When a new version is available, you'll see a prompt to update.
- **💻 Desktop Support**: Install on desktop computers too for quick access.

To install:

1. In Chrome/Edge (desktop): Click the install icon in the address bar
2. On Android: Select "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu
3. On iOS: Use Safari's share menu and select "Add to Home Screen"

Note: While the UI works offline, MIDI connectivity naturally requires your Deluge to be physically connected.

## Technical Tidbits 🤓

DEx leverages the **WebMIDI API** to communicate with the Deluge using MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx) messages. It sends commands to request information and receives data back, including display states and debug messages.

- **Display Rendering**: The OLED display (128×48 pixels) data is received in a compressed 7-to-8 bit RLE format. DEx unpacks this efficiently and renders it onto an HTML `<canvas>` element. Delta updates are used for smoother refreshes.
- **Copy Base64**: The OLED buffer can be copied as a gzipped, base64-encoded string (not a PNG) for sharing or embedding. The output is a markdown directive like `::screen[BASE64]{alt="Canvas Image"}`.
- **Responsive Design**: The fullscreen mode uses adaptive scaling to provide optimal visibility on displays of all sizes, from mobile phones to large projector screens.
- **Progressive Web App**: DEx uses service workers and a web app manifest to enable offline capabilities, app installation, and background updates.
- **SysEx Format**: Deluge commands generally follow the format `F0 7D [command] [parameters] F7`.
  - Ping: `F0 7D 00 F7`
  - Request OLED: `F0 7D 02 00 01 F7`
  - Request 7-Segment: `F0 7D 02 01 00 F7`
  - Request Debug: `F0 7D 03 00 01 F7`
  - Request Features: `F0 7D 03 01 01 F7`
  - Request Version: `F0 7D 03 02 01 F7`
