# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18 (the project is regularly tested with the latest LTS release).
- **Yarn (classic)** v1.x – the repo uses the lock-file generated by Yarn-1.

You can install Yarn globally with:

```bash
yarn set version classic
```

> **Why Yarn?** Vite's blazing-fast dev server combined with Yarn's parallel installation makes the feedback loop as short as possible. Using the same package-manager across the team also guarantees reproducible installs thanks to `yarn.lock`.

---

## Getting the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silicakes/deluge-extensions.git  # or your fork
cd deluge-extentions
```

---

## Installing dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

All required packages (production & dev) will be pulled as defined in `package.json`.

---

## Running a development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command starts the Vite dev-server with hot-module-replacement (HMR). By default you can open

```
http://localhost:5173
```

in your browser. Any file save will trigger an instant refresh.

If port 5173 is taken Vite will pick the next free port and print it to the console.

---

## Static type-checking

```bash
yarn typecheck
```

Runs the TypeScript compiler in **no-emit** mode to make sure the codebase type-checks.

---

## Running the test-suite

```bash
yarn test          # one-off
# or
yarn test:watch    # watch-mode with Vitest
```

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) which has first-class Vite integration and extremely fast cold-starts.

---

## Building a production bundle

```bash
yarn build
```

1. First the TypeScript project references are compiled (see `tsconfig.*.json`).
2. Afterwards Vite produces an optimised, minified bundle in the `dist/` folder.

> **Tip :** To inspect the production bundle locally run `yarn preview` which serves the files from `dist/` with the same configuration Vercel/GitHub-Pages would use.

## Repo layout

└── package.json
```

## Linting & formatting

The repo relies on Prettier for code-formatting. Most editors pick up the configuration automatically. You can enforce the formatting with:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

> ESLint is not yet wired-up – feel free to open a PR if you miss linting rules.

---

## IDE support

When using VS Code we recommend installing the following extensions:

- **Prettier – Code formatter**
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**
- **Typescript React (TSX)** (built-in)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                             | Fix                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Command not found: yarn"         | `corepack enable` (Node ≥16.13) or `npm i -g yarn`                                        |
| Changed deps are not reflected    | Stop the dev-server and run `yarn dev` again – Vite occasionally caches aggressively      |
| Preact fast-refresh stops working | Make sure you are on the latest Node LTS & the `@preact/preset-vite` plugin is up-to-date |
